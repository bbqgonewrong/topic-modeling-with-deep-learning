Topic Modelling using deep learning techniques
Deep Learning Models have been used extensively for Place Classification. The main aim of this project is to check whether the probabilistic approaches such as LDA can be used in Deep Learning models in order
to perform Place Classi cation.Topic modelling is chosen as a technique,aiming to automatically deriving topics during the training of Deep Networks for the task of place recognition. The Datasets used for the project
are EgoPlaces as well as the Places365 Dataset. The results of the Topic model architectures proposed are compared with the results from a baseline model which is used for Place Classi cation. The topic models were
able to reach around 70% testing accuracy for the EgoRoutine dataset as well as around 10% accuracy for the Places365 dataset with around 4% top-1 prediction accuracy for the EgoRoutine dataset. The Topic models
are not able to achieve comparable results to the baseline Place Classication model. However, it does exhibit the distribution of 1000 objects in into different Topics for a particular place.
